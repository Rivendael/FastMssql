# Azure SQL Server Configuration
AZURE_SQL_SERVER=yourserver.database.windows.net
AZURE_SQL_DATABASE=yourdatabase

# Service Principal Authentication
# Create a Service Principal in Azure AD and grant it access to your SQL Database
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-service-principal-client-id
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-service-principal-client-secret
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-azure-tenant-id

# User-Assigned Managed Identity (optional)
# Use this if you're running on an Azure resource with a user-assigned managed identity
AZURE_USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=your-user-assigned-identity-client-id

# Pre-obtained Access Token (optional)
# Use this if you already have a valid access token from another Azure service
AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-pre-obtained-access-token

# Azure CLI Configuration (for Default credential chain)
# Make sure you're logged in with: az login
# The default credential chain will try these methods in order:
# 1. Environment variables (above)
# 2. Managed Identity (if running on Azure)
# 3. Azure CLI (if logged in)
# 4. Azure PowerShell (if logged in)

# Additional Notes:
# - For production, store secrets in Azure Key Vault or similar secure storage
# - Use Managed Identity whenever possible on Azure resources
# - Service Principal should have minimal required permissions on the SQL Database
# - Consider using Azure AD groups for easier permission management
